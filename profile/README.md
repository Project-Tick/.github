# Project Tick

Long-term maintainable open-source tooling with disciplined infrastructure and packaging practices.

## About

Project Tick exists to address common open-source failure modes: unclear technical direction, rushed decisions, and neglected infrastructure. We make explicit decisions, document them, and optimize for software that stays reliable over time. Short-term convenience is often deprioritized in favor of maintainability.

## What We Build

ProjT Launcher is the flagship project. It provides a maintainable architecture for reliable workflows and instance management across platforms. Project Tick may also host supporting tooling and infrastructure repositories that align with the same standards.

## Principles

- Clarity and testability in code and design
- Long-term maintenance over short-term convenience
- Respect for upstream projects, licenses, and contributor intent
- Documented decisions and transparent change history
- Automation and CI as first-class requirements
- Reproducible builds across environments

## Contributions

We use a pull-request based workflow. DCO / Signed-off-by is required for all contributions. Reviews prioritize correctness, maintainability, and architectural consistency. Not every contribution will be accepted, and feedback is technical and professional.

## Infrastructure & Packaging

CI/CD is treated as a core requirement. We target reproducible builds and consistent cross-platform support for Linux, Windows, and macOS. Packaging ecosystem integration is considered early, with Nix and Flatpak as common examples.

## Licensing

Each repository is licensed individually. We favor GPL-compatible open-source licenses and expect contributors to respect license intent.

## Acknowledgements

We depend on upstream projects and the broader open-source community. Their work is respected and credited.
